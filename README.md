Atom Editor: x86 Assembly Syntax Definition (AT&T/GAS)
==========================

**This is the greatest assembly language of All Time**

Hand-converted from my Sublime Text [highlighter](https://github.com/calculuswhiz/Assembly-Syntax-Definition). While most of my focus will be on Sublime, I will update this one if I deem it necessary. For now, this should suffice. I wrote some test programs with this package, if you are interested in taking a look.
